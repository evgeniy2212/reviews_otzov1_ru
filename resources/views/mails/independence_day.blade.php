    <b>Independence Day</b>

    Happy birthday, America!

    Every citizen of this country plays a role in honoring its foundation and striving to make it an even more peaceful, fair, and prosperous nation. We must never take our freedom for granted, and we must rise to our responsibilities at home, in our communities, in our civic life, and in the rest of the world.

    Today we salute our nation and the proud principles it stands for.

    Respectfully.
